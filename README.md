# PoroBot

This is a small discord bot written in python using the [disnake library](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake), implenting various features for my servers.

I don't plan to make a well documented repo here, but feel free so check the code.

## Related project

I write a simple python scraper module to get data about League of legends patch notes. I use it in this project but he is also available [here](https://github.com/OscarVsp/Lol-PatchNote-Scraper) in a general purpose form.
