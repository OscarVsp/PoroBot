# PoroBot

This is a small discord bot written in python using the [disnake library](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake), implenting various lol features for my servers.

I don't plan to make a well documented repo here, but feel free check the code if you want.

# Docker

`docker pull oscarvsp/porobot:amd-latest`
